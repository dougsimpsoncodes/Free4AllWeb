# Free4All - Sports-Triggered Food Deal Platform

## Overview

Free4All is a web-based platform that automatically notifies users when free or discounted food is available based on local sports team performance, specifically starting with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The application scrapes sports data and triggers email alerts when promotional conditions are met at partner restaurants.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Landing page preference: "Never Miss Another Deal" as primary tagline/title - updated from "Never Miss Free Food Again" to reflect both free and discounted promotions.
Design preference: Green-to-blue gradient color scheme applied consistently across header and hero sections for cohesive branding.
Header preference: Centered logo without top CTA button for cleaner, more focused design.
Logo sizing: Reduced header height to h-12 (50% smaller). Free4All logo now 2xl text with 8x8 icon, hero title 2xl for better visual hierarchy.
Hero text sizing: Reduced subtitle from xl to lg to match the smaller header proportions.
Hero section sizing: Reduced padding by 50% (py-16 to py-8) and tightened internal spacing for more compact design.
Hero section background: Changed from green-to-blue gradient to dark gray gradient (gray-800 to gray-900) for better visual separation from header.
Button text: Changed from "Get Free Food Alerts"/"Start Getting Free Food" to simple "Sign Up" for cleaner messaging.
Language update: Changed all references from "free food" to "deals" throughout the landing page to accurately reflect both free and discounted promotions.
Mobile optimization: Reduced text sizes by 20% (4xl→3xl, xl→lg, lg→base) and changed "LA teams" to "your teams" for broader appeal and better mobile experience.
UI preference: Precision Mode toggle redesigned as intuitive ON/OFF button instead of confusing "Show All Sites" vs "Precision Mode" states.
**Primary Focus**: LA Dodgers as the core team for deal discovery and promotion tracking.
