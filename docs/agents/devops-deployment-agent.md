## ðŸš€ **Deployment Strategy Implementation**

### **Blue-Green Deployment**
```yaml
blue_green_deployment:
  strategy: "Maintain two identical production environments"
  process:
    1: "Deploy new version to idle environment (Green)"
    2: "Run automated tests on Green environment"
    3: "Switch load balancer from Blue to Green"
    4: "Monitor Green environment for issues"
    5: "Keep Blue environment for quick rollback if needed"
  
  benefits:

    - "Instant rollback capability"
    - "Full environment testing before switch"
```

### **Canary Deployment**
```yaml

  strategy: "Gradual rollout to subset of users"
  phases:
    phase_1: "Deploy to 5% of users"
    phase_2: "Monitor key metrics for 30 minutes"
    phase_3: "Expand to 25% of users if metrics are healthy"
    phase_4: "Continue to 50%, then 100% based on performance"
  
  rollback_triggers:
    - "Error rate increase > 2%"
    - "Response time increase > 20%"
    - "User complaints or support tickets"
```

### **Database Migration Strategy**
