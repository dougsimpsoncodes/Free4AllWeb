## ðŸ—‚ **Database Schema Design**

### **Core Tables with Optimization**
```sql
-- Optimized for high-frequency game data
CREATE TABLE games (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    opponent VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    game_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    is_home BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    team_score INTEGER,
    opponent_score INTEGER,
    is_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    game_stats JSONB,
    external_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_games_team_date (team_id, game_date DESC),
    INDEX idx_games_completion (is_complete, game_date),
    INDEX idx_games_external (external_id)
);

-- Optimized for deal discovery workflow
CREATE TABLE discovered_sites (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
    source VARCHAR(50),
    discovered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    metadata JSONB,
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_sites_status_confidence (status, confidence DESC),
    INDEX idx_sites_source_date (source, discovered_at),
    INDEX idx_sites_pending (status) WHERE status = 'pending'
);

-- Optimized for user preferences and notifications
CREATE TABLE alert_preferences (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    restaurant_id INTEGER REFERENCES restaurants(id),
    notification_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'email',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_prefs_user_active (user_id, is_active),
    INDEX idx_prefs_team_active (team_id, is_active),
    UNIQUE (user_id, team_id, restaurant_id, notification_type)
);
```

### **Advanced Indexing Strategy**
```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_games_trigger_analysis 
ON games (team_id, is_complete, game_date) 
WHERE is_complete = true;

-- Partial indexes for common filters
CREATE INDEX idx_active_deals 
ON triggered_deals (team_id, expires_at) 
WHERE is_active = true AND expires_at > NOW();

-- GIN indexes for JSONB search
CREATE INDEX idx_game_stats_gin 
ON games USING GIN (game_stats);

-- Functional indexes for computed values
CREATE INDEX idx_deal_confidence_tier 
ON discovered_sites ((CASE 
    WHEN confidence >= 0.8 THEN 'high'
    WHEN confidence >= 0.6 THEN 'medium'
    ELSE 'low'
END));
```

---

## ðŸš¨ **Data Integrity & Error Handling**

### **Transaction Management**
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensure all critical operations are fully ACID compliant
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Implement consistent locking order and retry logic
- **Long Transaction Management**: Break up long-running operations appropriately
- **Isolation Level Management**: Use appropriate isolation levels for different operations

### **Constraint Management**
```sql
-- Data quality constraints
ALTER TABLE games 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_valid_scores 
CHECK (team_score >= 0 AND opponent_score >= 0);

ALTER TABLE discovered_sites 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_confidence_range 
CHECK (confidence >= 0 AND confidence <= 1);

ALTER TABLE triggered_deals 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_expiry_future 
CHECK (expires_at > created_at);

-- Referential integrity with cascading rules
ALTER TABLE alert_preferences 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_cascade 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### **Backup & Recovery Strategy**
```yaml
backup_strategy:
  full_backups:
    frequency: "Daily at 2 AM"
    retention: "30 days"
    compression: true
    encryption: true
  
  incremental_backups:

DECLARE
    start_date date;
    end_date date;
BEGIN
    start_date := date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE);
    end_date := start_date + interval '1 month';
    
    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games_%s PARTITION OF games_partitioned
                    FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
                   to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM'),
                   start_date,
                   end_date);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW team_season_stats AS
SELECT 
    team_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_games,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE team_score > opponent_score) as wins,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE team_score < opponent_score) as losses,
    AVG(team_score) as avg_runs_scored,
    AVG(opponent_score) as avg_runs_allowed,

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_analytics_views()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY team_season_stats;
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY deal_performance_stats;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 1000  -- Queries taking more than 1 second
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;

-- Table bloat monitoring
CREATE VIEW table_bloat AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as index_size
