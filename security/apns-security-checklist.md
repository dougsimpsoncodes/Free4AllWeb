# APNs Security Implementation Checklist

## Pre-Production Security Checklist

### ✅ Credential Generation and Storage
- [ ] APNs authentication key generated in Apple Developer Portal
- [ ] Key downloaded and immediately moved to secure location
- [ ] Key file permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- [ ] Encrypted backup created and stored separately
- [ ] Original download deleted from Downloads folder
- [ ] Key ID, Team ID, and Bundle ID recorded securely

### ✅ Local Development Setup
- [ ] `.env` file contains only file path reference (not inline key)
- [ ] `credentials/` directory created with 700 permissions
- [ ] APNs key file placed in `credentials/` with 600 permissions
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes `credentials/`, `.env`, and `*.p8`
- [ ] Test script runs successfully: `node scripts/test-apns-setup.js`
- [ ] APNs service initializes without errors in dev server

### ✅ Production Security Configuration
- [ ] Environment variables configured in secure secret management
- [ ] Private key stored as encrypted secret (not environment variable)
- [ ] Container/pod security context uses non-root user
- [ ] File system mounted with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Network policies restrict APNs traffic to Apple's servers only
- [ ] Monitoring endpoint secured with admin authentication

### ✅ Security Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] APNs status monitoring endpoint implemented
- [ ] Security monitoring script deployed and scheduled
- [ ] Log aggregation configured for APNs events
- [ ] Alerting configured for credential issues
- [ ] Invalid token cleanup automation verified
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking enabled

### ✅ Incident Response Preparation
- [ ] Incident response plan documented and reviewed
- [ ] Emergency contact list updated
- [ ] Credential rotation procedure documented
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Team training on security procedures completed
- [ ] Communication channels for security incidents established

## Production Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] APNs credentials tested in staging environment
- [ ] Push notifications successfully sent to test devices
- [ ] Error handling verified with invalid device tokens
- [ ] Performance under load tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Backup procedures verified

### ✅ Deployment Process
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime
- [ ] Credentials deployed via secure secret management
- [ ] Health checks pass after deployment
- [ ] APNs service initializes successfully
- [ ] Sample push notification sent and received
- [ ] Monitoring confirms service is healthy

### ✅ Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] APNs status endpoint returns healthy status
- [ ] Push notifications working end-to-end
- [ ] Error rates within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Log aggregation receiving APNs events
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Performance metrics within expected ranges

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- [ ] Monitor APNs service health dashboard
- [ ] Review error rates and failed notifications
- [ ] Check for security alerts from monitoring scripts
- [ ] Verify backup systems are operational

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review APNs performance metrics
- [ ] Analyze invalid token cleanup statistics
- [ ] Check credential file permissions
- [ ] Verify log retention and rotation

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review and update security documentation
- [ ] Analyze incident response metrics
- [ ] Conduct security access review
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Rotate APNs authentication keys
- [ ] Conduct full security assessment
- [ ] Review and update incident response plan
- [ ] Team security training refresh
- [ ] Compliance audit for data protection

## Security Best Practices Compliance

### ✅ Principle of Least Privilege
- [ ] APNs key has minimal required permissions
- [ ] Service accounts have restricted access
- [ ] Admin endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] File permissions follow least privilege model

### ✅ Defense in Depth
- [ ] Multiple layers of access control
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Network segmentation implemented
- [ ] Monitoring at multiple levels

### ✅ Zero Trust Security
- [ ] All API calls authenticated and authorized
- [ ] Internal service communication secured
- [ ] Regular security assessments conducted
- [ ] Continuous monitoring implemented

## Compliance Requirements

### ✅ Data Protection (GDPR/CCPA)
- [ ] User consent for push notifications documented
- [ ] Data minimization in push payloads
- [ ] Right to deletion implemented for device tokens
- [ ] Privacy policy updated with push notification usage

### ✅ Security Standards (SOC 2)
- [ ] Access controls documented and implemented
- [ ] Security monitoring and logging configured
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented
- [ ] Regular security assessments scheduled

### ✅ Apple Requirements
- [ ] APNs usage complies with Apple Guidelines
- [ ] Push certificate/key properly configured
- [ ] Content guidelines followed for notifications
- [ ] User experience guidelines met
