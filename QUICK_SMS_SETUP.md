# SMS Not Arriving - Quick Fix Guide

## üîç Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Twilio API**: Working (success responses with message IDs)
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Fixed (32-char Auth Token, AC Account SID)  
- ‚ùå **Message Delivery**: Not reaching your phone +1 (310) 428-0616

## üö® Most Likely Issue: Twilio Trial Account

**Twilio trial accounts require phone number verification before sending SMS.**

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Login to Twilio Console**: console.twilio.com
2. **Go to Phone Numbers**: Left sidebar ‚Üí Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Verified Caller IDs
3. **Add Your Phone**: Click "Add a new number" 
4. **Enter**: +13104280616
5. **Verify**: Twilio will call/text you a verification code
6. **Complete verification**: Enter the code they send

### Alternative Check:
- **Trial Account Status**: Look for "Trial" badge in top-right of Twilio Console
- **Account Balance**: $0.00 means trial account with restrictions
- **Upgrade Option**: Available if trial account needs full access

## üéØ After Verification:

Once your phone number is verified:
1. I'll send another test SMS immediately  
2. You should receive it within 30-60 seconds
3. Your SMS system will be fully operational

## ‚ö° Test Again:
After verifying your phone number, let me know and I'll immediately send test messages to confirm delivery!

**Note**: The API responses show success, which means Twilio accepted the requests - the issue is likely the trial account phone verification requirement.
